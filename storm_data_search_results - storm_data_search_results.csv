The heavy rain was triggered by the approach of a strong Pacific low pressure system from the west, coupled with an infusion of deeper moisture shed from Tropical Storm Sergio which passed by earlier to the south of Arizona. A Flash Flood Warning was in effect at the time of the flash flooding and fortunately no accidents were reported.","A strong Pacific upper level low pressure system moved into Arizona during the morning hours on October 13th and triggered the development of widespread moderate to heavy showers across the south-central deserts.
